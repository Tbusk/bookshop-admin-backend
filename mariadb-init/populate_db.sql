point of view - From the "literary icon" (Oprah Daily) and
Pulitzer Prize Finalist whose novel Erasure is the basis for Cord
Jefferson''s critically acclaimed film American Fiction "If you
liked Demon Copperhead, by Barbara Kingsolver, read James, by
Percival Everett" --The Washington Post When the enslaved Jim
overhears that he is about to be sold to a man in New Orleans,
separated from his wife and daughter forever, he decides to hide
on nearby Jackson Island until he can formulate a plan.
Meanwhile, Huck Finn has faked his own death to escape his
violent father, recently returned to town. As all readers of
American literature know, thus begins the dangerous and
transcendent journey by raft down the Mississippi River toward
the elusive and too-often-unreliable promise of the Free States
and beyond. While many narrative set pieces of Adventures of
Huckleberry Finn remain in place (floods and storms, stumbling
across both unexpected death and unexpected treasure in the
myriad stopping points along the river''s banks, encountering the
scam artists posing as the Duke and Dauphin...), Jim''s agency,
intelligence and compassion are shown in a radically new light.
Brimming with the electrifying humor and lacerating observations
that have made Everett a "literary icon" (Oprah Daily), and one
of the most decorated writers of our lifetime, James is destined
to be a major publishing event and a cornerstone of twenty-first
century American literature.', 'Historical', 'https://images-

to React" made its debut in 2016, and since then, I''ve almost
rewritten it annually. This book teaches the core principles of
React, guiding you through building a practical application in
pure React without complex tooling. The book covers everything
from setting up the project to deploying it on a server. Each
    chapter includes additional recommended reading and exercises. By
    the end, you''ll have the skills to develop your own React
applications. In "The Road to React," I establish a solid
foundation before delving into the broader React ecosystem. The
book clarifies general concepts, patterns, and best practices for
real-world React applications. Ultimately, you''ll learn to
construct a React application from scratch, incorporating
    features such as pagination, client-side and server-side
    searching, and advanced UI interactions like sorting. Is it up
    to date? Programming books are usually outdated soon after their
    release, but since this book is self- published, I can update it
    as needed whenever a new version of something related to this
    book gets released. I am a beginner. Is this book for me? Yes.
    The book starts from zero and takes you through the learning
    experience step by step. Every chapter builds up on the learnings
from the previous chapter. In addition, at the end of every
    chapter, exercises fortify your lessons learned. If you got stuck
    in a chapter, you will always find a reference URL to the status
    quo of the actual code. Core Concepts Pragmatic: Master React
